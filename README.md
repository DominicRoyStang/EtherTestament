Ethereum sample smart contracts README

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository was created while I was taking notes as I was learning about Solidity.
It can be used as a learning resource for people who already know how to program, and are interested in getting started with Solidity.

### How do I get set up? ###

Easy way: copy/paste the contents of the .sol files on Remix, a solidity online IDE: 
https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.4.19+commit.c4cbbb05.js

Make sure you are using compiler version 0.4.19

You can run individual functions by clicking their names in the "Run" tab.
More information on Remix here: https://remix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
